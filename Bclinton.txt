speech at Democratic National Convention, July 26, 2004:
America just works better when more people have a chance to live their dreams.


BILL CLINTON:
The best social program is a good job.


BILL CLINTON:
I do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until people who are willing to work have work. Work organizes life. It gives structure and discipline to life.


speech at Campus Progress National Student Conference, July 13, 2005:
You don’t have to wait till your party’s in power to have an impact on life at home and around the world.


speech at Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992:
Frankly, I'm fed up with politicians in Washington lecturing the rest of us about family values. Our families have values. But our government doesn’t.


speech at Campus Progress National Student Conference, July 13, 2005:
You can’t blame your opponents for applying a strategy that beats your brains out with regularity.


speech at Campus Progress National Student Conference, July 13, 2005:
People really don’t care if politicians attack each other with untrue stories. They figure if you don’t want to get hurt, you shouldn’t have filed for office. They figure whatever happens to us, our lives will be better than theirs.


speech at Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992:
The most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy, and foreign policy America can have is an expanding entrepreneurial economy of high-wage, high-skilled jobs.


BILL CLINTON:
The future is not an inheritance, it is an opportunity and an obligation.


BILL CLINTON:
The price of doing the same old thing is far higher than the price of change.


BILL CLINTON:
Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world. And the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.

speech at Democratic National Convention, July 26, 2004:
Americans long to be united. After 9/11, we all just wanted to be one nation. Not a single American on September the 12, 2001, cared who won the next presidential election.


BILL CLINTON:
For too long we've been told about "us" and "them." Each and every election we see a new slate of arguments and ads telling us that "they" are the problem, not "us." But there can be no "them" in America. There's only us.


BILL CLINTON, speech, June 9, 1997:
Banning human cloning reflects our humanity. It is the right thing to do. Creating a child through this new method calls into question our most fundamental beliefs. It has the potential to threaten the sacred family bonds at the very core of our ideals and our society. At its worst, it could lead to misguided and malevolent attempts to select certain traits, even to create certain kind of children -- to make our children objects rather than cherished individuals.


speech at DNC, Aug. 29, 1996:
Abortion should not only be safe and legal, it should be rare.


BILL CLINTON:
If you live long enough, you'll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, you'll be a better person.


interview on Larry King Live, June 1, 2005:
I mean, you know, this idea that somebody we disagree with on economic or social policy or something we have to turn into some kind of ogre or demon, I think, is a mistake. I mean, it's like telling the American people or half the American people that don't agree with you they're all fools. That's just not true.


First Inaugural Address, Jan. 20, 1992:
There is nothing wrong in America that can't be fixed with what is right in America.


speech at Democratic National Convention, August 29, 1996:
I still believe in a place called Hope, a place called America.


Woman's Day Magazine, Jul. 10, 2007:
When we give what we can and give it with joy, we don't just renew the American tradition of giving, we also renew ourselves.


speech at Democratic National Convention, Sep. 5, 2012:
We Democrats think the country works better with a strong middle class, real opportunities for poor people to work their way into it and a relentless focus on the future, with business and government working together to promote growth and broadly shared prosperity. We think "we're all in this together" is a better philosophy than "you're on your own."


speech at Democratic National Convention, Sep. 5, 2012:
When you stifle human potential, when you don’t invest in new ideas, it doesn’t just cut off the people who are affected. It hurts us all.


BILL CLINTON, Back to Work:
Downsizing budgets may be necessary, but downsizing dreams is a decision to be disappointed.


speech at the Lincoln Memorial on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Aug. 28, 2013:
A great democracy does not make it harder to vote than to buy an assault weapon.


State of the Union Address, Jan. 19, 1999:
Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be One America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as One America.


The Economist, Dec. 18, 2010:
There's never a perfect bipartisan bill in the eyes of a partisan.


BILL CLINTON, My Life:
If you want to live like a Republican, vote like a Democrat.


Presidential Debate, Oct. 19, 1992:
I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy. Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one. I will deal with them from day 1. They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.


remarks at the dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Archives and Research Center in Storrs, Connecticut, Oct. 15, 1995:
The road to tyranny, we must never forget, begins with the destruction of the truth.


BILL CLINTON, Back to Work:
The success of the Republicans' antigovernment attack was doubly surprising to me, because of their own record over the previous eight years. They cut taxes and increased spending at roughly twice the rate it had increased during my eight years in office, creating few new jobs but ending four years of balanced budgets and surpluses and doubling the national debt even before the financial meltdown. And, of course, they also regularly voted to raise the debt limit so they could continue to borrow and spend, a practice I had worked hard to end.


speech at Democratic National Convention, Sep. 5, 2012:
Democracy does not have to be a bloodsport, it can be an honorable enterprise that advances the public interest.


Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, William J. Clinton:
We need to reform our job training programs, especially our unemployment system, and transform it into a reemployment system.


interview with Mark Riley and Laura Blackburne of WLIB Radio, New York City, October 18, 1994:
If you look at the opportunities for economic growth within America, inner-city areas and rural areas, especially those that are heavily minority populated are a great opportunity for economic growth, because unemployment is high and the potential for consumer demand to grow is enormous. So the first thing we've got to do is to get some money in there.


remarks on Memorial Day, 1996:
Here on this peaceful hillside, the silent rows of headstones tell tales of service and sacrifice that are so much the story of our nation. Here lies the spirit that has guided our country for more than 200 years now. Nurses and drummer boys, scouts and engineers, warriors and peacemakers--joined by a shared devotion to defend our nation, protect our freedom, keep America strong and proud.


speech at Democratic National Convention, Sep. 5, 2012:
When times are tough, constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world, cooperation works better.



speech at the Lincoln Memorial on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Aug. 28, 2013:
So how are we going to repay the debt? Dr. King’s dream of interdependence, his prescription of wholehearted cooperation across racial lines -- they ring as true today as they did 50 years ago. Oh, yes, we face terrible political gridlock now. Read a little history; it’s nothing new. Yes, there remain racial inequalities in employment, income, health, wealth, incarceration, and in the victims and perpetrators of violent crime. But we don’t face beatings, lynchings and shootings for our political beliefs anymore. And I would respectfully suggest that Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear his heirs whine about political gridlock. It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back.


statement, May 21, 2004:
You should have disagreements with your leaders and your colleagues, but if it becomes immediately a question of questioning people's motives, and if immediately you decide that somebody who sees a whole new situation differently than you must be a bad person and somehow twisted inside, we are not going to get very far in forming a more perfect union.


Presidential Debate, Oct. 19, 1992:
We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit. Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.


New York Times, Aug. 29, 1998:
All of you know I'm having to become quite an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness. And I ... It gets a little easier the more you do it. And if you have a family, an Administration, a Congress and a whole country to ask, you're going to get a lot of practice. But I have to tell that in these last days it has come home to me again, something I first learned as President, but it wasn't burned in my bones -- and that is that in order to get it, you have to be willing to give it. And all of us -- the anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the desire for recrimination against people you believe have wronged you -- they harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted wounds. And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people we have wronged.


The Independent, Oct. 3, 2002:
I don't care how precise your bombs and your weapons are, when you set them off, innocent people will die.


speech, Mar. 20, 2008:
I think it would be a great thing if we had an election year where you had two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interest of this country. And people could actually ask themselves who is right on these issues, instead of all this other stuff that always seems to intrude itself on our politics.


BILL CLINTON, Back to Work:
We are rapidly becoming more and more enmeshed in an interdependent world, one with more rising economic powers and more widely dispersed political influence. Anybody who was thinking about it on the day the Berlin Wall fell realized then that America had become the world's sole economic, political, and military superpower but that it couldn't last very long. If you believe that intelligence and effort are equally distributed, then you shouldn't begrudge the fact that our interdependent world is bound to give more people in other nations the chance to claim their dreams, more nations a chance to rise or to reinvent themselves and rise again. And if you really believe in freedom and free markets, you shouldn't complain about the competition but learn from it.


BILL CLINTON, My Life:
All my life I've been interested in other people's stories. I've wanted to know them, understand them, feel them. When I grew up and got into politics, I always felt the main point of my work was to give people a chance to have better stories.


speech at Democratic National Convention, Jul. 26, 2004:
Strength and wisdom are not opposing values.


remarks at Adult Learning Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Mar. 1, 1993:
You know, we can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles -- it's something I strongly support -- we can't be so fixated on that that we are unable to think about the reality of life that millions of Americans face on streets that are unsafe, under conditions that no other nation ... has permitted to exist.


interview with Chris Wallace, FOX News, Sep. 24, 2006:
I think it's very interesting that all the conservative Republicans who now say I didn't do enough claimed that I was too obsessed with Bin Laden. All of President Bush's neo-cons thought I was too obsessed with Bin Laden. They had no meetings on Bin Laden for nine months after I left office. All the right-wingers who now say I didn't do enough, said I did too much—same people.


speech at the Lincoln Memorial on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Aug. 28, 2013:
The whole American landscape is littered with the lost dreams and dashed hopes of people of all races. And the great irony of the current moment is that the future has never brimmed with more possibilities. It has never burned brighter in what we could become if we push open those stubborn gates and if we do it together.


BILL CLINTON, Back to Work:
Our constitution was designed by people who were idealistic but not ideological. There's a big difference. You can have a philosophy that tends to be liberal or conservative but still be open to evidence, experience, and argument. That enables people with honest differences to find practical, principled compromise. On the other hand, fervent insistence on an ideology makes evidence, experience, and arguments irrelevant: If you possess the absolute truth, those who disagree are by definition wrong, and evidence of success or failure is irrelevant. There is nothing to learn from the experience of other countries. Respectful arguments are a waste of time. Compromise is weakness. And if your policies fail, you don't abandon them; instead, you double down, asserting that they would have worked if only they had been carried to their logical extreme.


BILL CLINTON, My Life:
We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so; instead, we have drifted. And that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.


New York Times, Apr. 19, 2010:
Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.


BILL CLINTON, My Life:
A man is more than the sum of all the things he can do.


speech at Democratic National Convention, Jul. 16, 1992:
Now, I don't have all the answers, but I do know the old ways don't work. Trickledown economics has sure failed. And big bureaucracies, both private and public, they've failed too. That's why we need a new approach to government, a government that offers more empowerment and less entitlement. More choices for young people in the schools they attend- in the public schools they attend. And more choices for the elderly and for people with disabilities and the long-term care they receive. A government that is leaner, not meaner; a government that expands opportunity, not bureaucracy; a government that understands that jobs must come from growth in a vibrant and vital system of free enterprise.


Grand Jury Testimony, Aug. 17, 1998:
It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the—if he—if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement. … Now, if someone had asked me on that day, are you having any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, that is, asked me a question in the present tense, I would have said no. And it would have been completely true.


BILL CLINTON, Back to Work:
My argument here isn't that Democrats are always right and Republicans always wrong. It's that by jamming all issues into the antigovernment, antitax, antiregulation straitjacket, we hog-tie ourselves and keep ourselves from making necessary changes no matter how much evidence exists to support them. The antigovernment paradigm blinds us to possibilities that lie outside its ideological litmus tests and prevents us from creating new networks of cooperation that can restore economic growth, bring economic opportunity to more people and places, and increase our ability to lead the world to a better future.



speech, March 21, 1998:
Today, I want to talk about Social Security and how all of us can ensure that one of the greatest achievements of this century continues to serve our people well into the next.... For 60 years, Social Security has meant more than an ID number on a tax form; more than a monthly check in the mail. It reflects our deepest values -- our respect for our parents and our belief that all Americans deserve to retire with dignity.

BILL CLINTON, attributed, Healthline:
We live in a completely interdependent world, which simply means we cannot escape each other. How we respond to AIDS depends, in part, on whether we understand this interdependence. It is not someone else's problem. This is everybody's problem.
